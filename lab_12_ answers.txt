1. How does your program detect a button press and trigger the game loop?
 - It uses the GPIO pin output to see if the button is pressed. It loops automatically unless it get's interupted with CTRL + C

2. If I ran the slot machine 1000 times and graphed the results on a number line, would the results look like? What would they look like for your rigged version?
 - It would have no pattern

3. How did you use randomness in your program? Was it truly random? How could you test it?
 - I used the random library and the string library to randomly choose A letter. I did this for all four letters..

4. How did you guarantee the results would favor winning? How did you change your game logic to accomplish this?
 - I used a boolean to know if I needed to overide the random letters or not. I changed them by making the function only return one letter.
